What can you do to help make Tabula better?

1. Bug reports and user interface feedback are always appreciated.
2. Front-end
  
3. Back-end
  * Convert ColumnGuesser.java into JRuby or jruby_dump_characters into Java. (This will save significant startup time by not having to start the JVM repeatedly.)
  * Ability to apply a lasso to all subsequent pages in a document.
  * Modify imgAreaSelect (or replace it with another JS library) to allow multiple selects. (The data should probably be concatenated, then made available for viewing/download/clipboard.)
